## Configuration file for CAVA.
[general]

# Accepts only non-negative values.
framerate = 72

# 'autosens' will attempt to decrease sensitivity if the bars peak. 1 = on, 0 = off
autosens = 1

# Manual sensitivity in %. If autosens is enabled, this will only be the initial value.
# 200 means double height. Accepts only non-negative values.
sensitivity = 90

# The number of bars (0-512). 0 sets it to auto (fill up console).
# Bars' width and space between bars in number of characters.
bars = 0
bar_width = 1
bar_spacing = 1

# Lower and higher cutoff frequencies for lowest and highest bars
# the bandwidth of the visualizer.
# Note: there is a minimum total bandwidth of 43Mhz x number of bars.
# Cava will automatically increase the higher cutoff if a too low band is specified.
lower_cutoff_freq = 40
higher_cutoff_freq = 400


[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are: 'fifo', 'portaudio', 'pipewire', 'alsa', 'pulse', 'sndio', 'oss', 'jack' or 'shmem'
# Defaults to 'oss', 'pipewire', 'sndio', 'jack', 'pulse', 'alsa', 'portaudio' or 'fifo', in that order, dependent on what support cava was built with.
# On Mac it defaults to 'portaudio' or 'fifo'
# On windows this is automatic and no input settings are needed.

# The options 'sample_rate', 'sample_bits', 'channels' and 'autoconnect' can be configured for some input methods:
#   sample_rate: fifo, pipewire, sndio, oss
#   sample_bits: fifo, pipewire, sndio, oss
#   channels:    sndio, oss, jack
#   autoconnect: jack
# Other methods ignore these settings.
#
# For 'sndio' and 'oss' they are only preferred values, i.e. if the values are not supported
# by the chosen audio device, the device will use other supported values instead.
# Example: 48000, 32 and 2, but the device only supports 44100, 16 and 1, then it
# will use 44100, 16 and 1.
#
sample_rate = 192000
sample_bits = 16
# channels = 2
# autoconnect = 2


[output]

# Output method. Can be 'ncurses', 'noncurses', 'raw', 'noritake', 'sdl'
# or 'sdl_glsl'.
# 'noncurses' (default) uses a buffer and cursor movements to only print
# changes from frame to frame in the terminal. Uses less resources and is less
# prone to tearing (vsync issues) than 'ncurses'.
#
# 'raw' is an 8 or 16 bit (configurable via the 'bit_format' option) data
# stream of the bar heights that can be used to send to other applications.
# 'raw' defaults to 200 bars, which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.
#
# 'noritake' outputs a bitmap in the format expected by a Noritake VFD display
#  in graphic mode. It only support the 3000 series graphical VFDs for now.
#
# 'sdl' uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer to render in a graphical context.
# 'sdl_glsl' uses SDL to create an OpenGL context. Write your own shaders or
# use one of the predefined ones.
method = noncurses

# Orientation of the visualization. Can be 'bottom', 'top', 'left' or 'right'.
# Default is 'bottom'. Other orientations are only supported on sdl and ncruses
# output. Note: many fonts have weird glyphs for 'top' and 'right' characters,
# which can make ncurses not look right.
orientation = bottom

# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.
# 'mono_option' set mono to either take input from 'left', 'right' or 'average'.
# set 'reverse' to 1 to display frequencies the other way around.
channels = mono
mono_option = average
# reverse = 0

# set label on bars on the x-axis. Can be 'frequency' or 'none'. Default: 'none'
# 'frequency' displays the lower cut off frequency of the bar above.
# Only supported on ncurses and noncurses output.
xaxis = none

# enable alacritty synchronized updates. 1 = on, 0 = off
# removes flickering in alacritty terminal emulator.
# defaults to off since the behaviour in other terminal emulators is unknown
alacritty_sync = 0

# Shaders for sdl_glsl, located in $HOME/.config/cava/shaders
vertex_shader = pass_through.vert
fragment_shader = bar_spectrum.frag

# for glsl output mode, keep rendering even if no audio
# continuous_rendering = 0

# disable console blank (screen saver) in tty
# (Not supported on FreeBSD)
# disable_blanking = 0

# show a flat bar at the bottom of the screen when idle, 1 = on, 0 = off
# show_idle_bar_heads = 1

# show waveform instead of frequency spectrum, 1 = on, 0 = off
# waveform = 0

[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.
# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within ''). User defined colors requires
# a terminal that can change color definitions such as Gnome-terminal or rxvt.
# default is to keep current terminal color
# background = default
# foreground = default

# SDL and sdl_glsl only support hex code colors, these are the default:
# background = '#111111'
# foreground = '#33ffff'


# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors are supported,
# background must also be defined in hex or remain commented out. 1 = on, 0 = off.
# You can define as many as 8 different colors. They range from bottom to top of screen
gradient = 1
gradient_count = 8
gradient_color_1 = '#0759B6'
gradient_color_2 = '#0061AC'
gradient_color_3 = '#0068A2'
gradient_color_4 = '#006E97'
gradient_color_5 = '#00748D'
gradient_color_6 = '#007981'
gradient_color_7 = '#017E76'
gradient_color_8 = '#0C8369'

[smoothing]

# Noise reduction, int 0 - 100. default 77
# the raw visualization is very noisy, this factor adjusts the integral and gravity filters to keep the signal smooth
# 100 will be very slow and smooth, 0 will be fast but noisy.
noise_reduction = 60


[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want.
# Remember to uncomment more than one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
# 1 = 1
# 2 = 1
# 3 = 1
# 4 = 1
